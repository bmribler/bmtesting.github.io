<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p><b>The problem.</b> </p>
<p>For NOAA and NASA, the data problem with their 
<a href="http://www.jpss.noaa.gov">
Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)</a> is how to best handle a 
large volume data stream from the five different instruments on a 
satellite. JPSS is a new generation of low Earth orbiting satellites 
that monitor environmental conditions and provide data for
long-range weather and climate forecasts. </p>


<!--
<p>complicated data streams, see http://www.jpss.noaa.gov/news-19.html
for comments on one instrument called CrIS, the Cross-track 
Infared Sounder. </p>
-->

<p>Here is NOAA's description of one of the instruments from a 2013 
<a href="http://www.jpss.noaa.gov/news-19.html">
news release</a>:</p>

<dir>
<p>
CrIS is the Cross-track Infrared Sounder. CrIS is the first in 
a series of advanced operational sounders that provides more accurate, 
detailed atmospheric temperature and moisture observations for weather 
and climate applications. This high-spectral resolution infrared 
instrument measures the three-dimensional structure of atmospheric 
temperatures, water vapor and trace gases. It provides more than 
1,000 infrared spectral channels at an improved horizontal spatial 
resolution and measure temperature profiles with keen vertical 
resolution to an accuracy approaching 1 Kelvin (the absolute 
temperature scale). This information helps significantly improve 
prediction, including both short-term weather &ldquo;now casting&rdquo; 
and longer-term forecasting. It also provides a vital tool for NOAA 
to continuously take the pulse of the planet and assist in 
understanding major seasonal and multi-year shifts.

<p><b>The solution: HDF5 and custom tools.</b></p>

<p>We know from other projects such as NASA's 
<a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esdis">
Earth Science Data and Information System</a> (ESDIS) project 
that HDF Group software can be used to store large amounts of climate 
data. ESDIS has in 
13 years (as of September 30, 2013) archived in our software 
<a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about-eosdis/performance">
9.8 petabytes</a> of climate data. Each petabyte is a million 
gigabytes. 
</p>

<p>How might data be extracted in a timely manner 
from such a large dataset? A data granule holds the data from a short 
period of observation by 
an instrument. Data is stored by granule in HDF5 files. With a custom 
tool built by The HDF Group, data granules can be aggregated and extracted. 
This means that only the data for a certain 
period of time and for a limited location need be retrieved from 
the data for study. This is much more efficient than having to 
open the entire file to see any amount of data. Since the 
archived data is not changed, data granules can be extracted
repeatedly, and the data files themselves only need to be downloaded once.
</p>

<!-- add a comment about longevity to another project perhaps
with a reference to the mapping project and other backward and 
forward compatibility efforts by THG.

-->

<!--
<p>With HDF5, data files can be built with hierarchical structures, data 
files can be built
to handle data from multiple sources.</p>

<p>After geolocation attributes are added, data from multiple 
instruments can be combined.</p>
-->

<!--
<p>This also means that data files only need 
to be downloaded once.</p>

<p style="background-color:#FFCC80">How much data? 
NOAA and NASA expect to archive ?????? petabytes over 
the life of the JPSS mission.<br /><br />
The following is on page 729 of a paper published in June 2010 and 
titled &ldquo;NPOESS: 
Next-Generation Operational Global Earth Observations&rdquo; by 
Thomas Lee and others at the Journal of the American 
Meteorological Society website 
at http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2009BAMS2953.1:</p>

<blockquote style="background-color:#FFCC80">NPOESS is expected to deliver a
total data volume of approximately 8 terabytes per
day, vastly exceeding the throughput of the current
POES and DMSP systems (~2 to 6 gigabytes per day)
and approximately 2–3 times greater than the data
volume delivered by the NASA EOS missions.</blockquote>

<p style="background-color:#FFCC80">From page 734: </p>
<blockquote style="background-color:#FFCC80">The NPOESS ground system architecture consisting 
of SafetyNet and the IDPS is expected to 
deliver 95% of the data within 28 min from the time of
collection. This major innovation will speed up data
delivery enormously. Today, data temporarily stored
on NOAA’s POES are delivered to a single ground
antenna once per orbit (~100-min orbital period).
The ground processing system adds another delay of
approximately 10 min–2 h. SafetyNet 
will employ 15 sites around the world that will download and
deliver data, sometimes within 2 min of acquisition.
The SafetyNet system can also be leveraged to accommodate other 
future satellite missions.</blockquote>



<p style="background-color:#FFCC80">
1.15.2014. There is a lot of information on the current JPSS project 
page. The top section has a general description of the project. 
The bottom section describes four areas of current focus. 
The third item, "Maintaining HDF5 software on systems used by JPSS/NPP" 
seems too detailed (too technical) for this project page if the purpose 
of this project page is to help people to decide to use HDF5. If this 
project page has been also used to support current users, then

<p>The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)</p>

<p>The aim of this project is to develop and adapt HDF5 technologies and 
provide HDF5 support for the <a href=" http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/jpss/">
Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)</a> and the 
<a href="http://npp.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Suomi National Polar-orbiting 
Partnership</a> (NPP)</a>. JPSS is part of the restructured National 
Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). This 
project is funded through <a href="http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/">
NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data & Information Service 
(NESDIS)</a>.</p>

<p> JPSS is a new generation of low Earth
orbiting satellites that monitor environmental conditions and provide data for
long-range weather and climate forecasts. The NPOESS project was established by
a 1994 Presidential Decision Directive to converge the polar-orbiting satellite
systems operated by the Department of Commerce and by the Department of Defense
into a single, cost-efficient integrated system. The new system would also take
advantage of the advanced remote sensing and spacecraft technologies provided
by NASA through its Earth Observing System.</p>

<p> The JPSS will circle the Earth approximately once every 100 minutes, delivering up
to eight terabytes of data concerning the Earth's weather, atmosphere, oceans,
land, and near-space environment. The data will be processed on the ground and
distributed within 30 minutes of observation to its central users, and to the
world within 24 hours.</p>

<p>The volume and complexity of the JPSS data, and the enormously high speed at which
it must be processed, requires powerful technology and expertise in using this
technology. JPSS data will be archived and distributed in HDF5.</p>

<p>The HDF Group provides support for JPSS/NPP data producers and users, as it has
done for more than 15 years for the <a
href="/projects/esdis/index.html"> NASA ESDIS program</a>
and its estimated 1.6 million users of petabytes of earth science data.</p>

<!-- the following was moved to the Software page

<p> The HDF Group JPSS project currently focuses on the following areas:</p>

<ul>
 <li><h3>Improving accessibility and usability of JPSS/NPP data</h3>

<p>JPSS data will be distributed in HDF5 files
containing raw data and indexing metadata that allows fast access to the raw
data. The HDF Group is developing software libraries and tools to provide easy
and intuitive access to this data.</p>

<p>As part of this effort, The HDF Group has created a <a
href="/projects/npoess/HL_index.html">
library</a> of C and Fortran routines to access and
manipulate data referenced by object and region references and to access and
manipulate data packed into integer values. We continue to seek feedback from
JPSS/NPP applications developers and users, as well as from the wider HDF5
community, and will improve this library as requested.</p>
 </li>

 <li><h3>Developing tools to facilitate access and management of JPSS/NPP data</h3>

<p>The HDF Group has enhanced the h5dump utility to display
data pointed to by region references and to display data packed into an integer
array. These new features became available in the HDF5 1.8.4 release.</p>

<p>HDFView has been enhanced to display data referenced by
object and region references; this feature became available in the HDF Java
Products release 2.6 and <a href="/products/java/hdf-java-html/hdfview/index.html">
later</a> . A feature to display data packed into an integer array (e.g., NPP qaulity flags) became available in the HDF Java release 2.7 <a
href="/downloads/">FTP download</a> .</p>

<p>Currently we are actively working on the 
<a href="/projects/npoess/h5edit_index.html"> h5edit</a>
and <a href="/projects/npoess/h5augjpss_index.html"> h5augjpss</a> tools, 
which will make it possible to change HDF5 files to make them more accessible and
meaningful for certain applications, most notably netCDF-based applications. We
are seeking feedback regarding these tools from JPSS applications developers
and JPSS data users.</p>
<p>We are also developing a
<a href="/projects/npoess/nagg_index.html">nagg</a> tool
for aggregating and packaging NPP granules. The tool allows 
rearranging NPP product data granules from existing files, e.g., downloaded from IDPS, into
new files with aggregations or packaging that are better suited as input for a particular application. 

</p>
