<h3>February 27, 2015:</h3>
<p><strong><a href="../projects/hdfserver/index.html">Announcing HDF REST Server (h5serv) 0.1.0</a></strong></p>

<p>
We are proud to announce the availability of HDF REST Server (h5serv) 0.1.0!
</p>
<p> HDF REST server is a Python-based web service that can be used to send and receive HDF5 data using an HTTP-based REST interface. HDF Server supports CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the full spectrum of HDF5 objects including: groups, links, datasets, attributes, and committed data types. As a REST service a variety of clients can be developed in JavaScript, Python, C, and other common languages.
</p>
<p>
The HDF Server extends the HDF5 data model to efficiently store large data objects (e.g. up to multi-TB data arrays) and access them over the web using a RESTful API. As datasets get larger and larger, it becomes impractical to download files to access data. Using HDF Server, data can be kept in one central location and content vended via well-defined URIs. This enables exploration and analysis of the data while minimizing the number of bytes that need to be transmitted over the network.
</p>

<p>
Since HDF Server supports both reading and writing of data, it enables some interesting scenarios such as:
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li3">
    Collaborative annotation of data sets
</li>
<li class="li3">
    Compute clusters that use HDF Server for data access
</li>
<li class="li3">
    Continually updated data shares (e.g. Stock Market quotes, sensor data)
</li>
<li class="li3">
    Storing the analysis of the data (say a visualization) with the original source data
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In addition to these, we would like to hear your ideas of how HDF Server could be utilized (as well as any other feedback you might have).
</p>
<p>
Thanks to everyone who helped and advised on this project.

<p>A team of researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and Cray Inc. performed a trillion-particle simulation on the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Centerâ(NERSCâ Cray XE6 âpperâThe experiment pushed the machine's capabilities by using more than 120,000 processors and generating approximately 350 terabytes of data. The team recently won the Best Paper award at the 2013 Cray User Group conference for their description of the simulation and its findings.</p>

<p>"This is the largest I/O job ever undertaken by a NERSC application. It is quite a feat when you consider that even the smallest bottleneck in a production I/O stack can degrade performance at scale," says Prabhat, a researcher in Berkeley Lab's Scientific Visualization Group and co-author of the paper. He further explained how progress made by the ExaHDF5 team over the course of the project made it possible "to demonstrate that HDF5 can scale to petascale platforms like Hopper and achieve near peak I/O rates."</p>

<p>ExaHDF5 is a Department of Energy funded collaboration, led by Prabhat, to develop high performance I/O and analysis strategies for future exascale computers. A primary goal of the project has been to expand the capabilities of HDF5 for petascale and future exascale platforms.</p>

<p>"The outcome of this work was truly ideal,â ran a state-of-the-art simulation code at scale, which ww
asnâpossible before, using the best computing resources and expertise, and this effort produced a first-time science result that no one had ever seen before. Computer science researchers always hope for such an outcome, but rarely do things come together in this fashion."

<p>
<b>NetCDF-4 Performance Report</b>
</p>
<p>
NetCDF-4 is an I/O software package that retains the original netCDF
APIs while using HDF5 to store the data.  Sponsored by NASA ESTO,
netCDF-4 is the result of a collaboration between Unidata and The HDF
Group.
</p>

<p>
The HDF Group has prepared a report on the performance of netCDF-4
that uses benchmarks and examples to:
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">compare the performance of netCDF-3 and netCDF-4</li>
<li class="li">discuss performance tuning with netCDF-4</li>
<li class="li">discuss performance pitfalls with netCDF-4</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Some of the performance tuning and pitfalls discussions may also be of
interest to users of HDF5 who do not use netCDF-4.
The report is available at:
